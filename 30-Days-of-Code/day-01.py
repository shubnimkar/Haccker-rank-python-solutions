"""
Task 
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized 
for you. You must:
Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) 
and initialize your variables.
Use the + operator to perform the following operations: 
    Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
    Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
    Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer that you must sum with i. 
The second line contains a double that you must sum with d. 
The third line contains a string that you must concatenate with s.

Output Format
Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles (scaled to 1 decimal place) 
on the second line, and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.

Sample Input
